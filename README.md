## Installation

### For Claude Desktop Users
```bash
# Add to Claude with email configuration
claude mcp add -e POE2SCOUT_CONTACT_EMAIL=your@email.com -- poe2scout-mcp node /path/to/dist/index.js
```

### For Developers
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanzan01/poe2scout-mcp.git
cd poe2scout-mcp
npm install
npm run build

# Set email (required by API)
export POE2SCOUT_CONTACT_EMAIL="your@email.com"
```

## Troubleshooting

### **"Prices look completely wrong"**
- Check the volume/quantity - low volume = unreliable price
- Trust high-volume items only (100+ quantity)
- Some currencies show data anomalies - focus on consistent patterns

### **"All unique item searches return empty"**
- Normal behavior - POE2Scout focuses on currency trading
- Limited unique item coverage
- Use official trade site for gear

### **"Divine price changed drastically"**
- Check both price AND volume
- Volume drops = temporary liquidity issue  
- Wait for volume normalization before trading large amounts

## Pro Trading Tips

1. **Always check volume** - Volume under 100 = price manipulation risk
2. **Divine Orb is your benchmark** - Most stable high-value currency  
3. **Exalted for baseline** - All prices measured in exalts
4. **Perfect Jeweller's for storage** - High value, good liquidity
5. **Cross-reference big trades** - Verify large value transactions

## Data Quality Notes

**‚úÖ Reliable Data:**
- Divine Orb pricing (consistently accurate)
- Volume/quantity data (helps identify bad prices)  
- Price history trends

**‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues:**
- Some currencies show extreme price swings
- Low volume items may have stale pricing
- Not real-time (updates periodically)
