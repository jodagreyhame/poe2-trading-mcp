## Description

Implement intelligent trade evaluation tools that analyze the fairness and value of proposed trades using real-time market data. This system will provide trade fairness scoring and detailed price comparison analysis to help users make informed trading decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `evaluate_trade` MCP tool implemented with comprehensive trade analysis
- [ ] Price comparison logic that accounts for market volatility
- [ ] Trade fairness scoring system with clear methodology
- [ ] Support for multi-item trades with complex value calculations
- [ ] Market trend analysis integration for timing recommendations
- [ ] Risk assessment based on item liquidity and market stability
- [ ] Detailed trade reports with actionable insights
- [ ] Historical trade data integration for pattern recognition

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **evaluate_trade Tool**
   - Accept arrays of offered and requested items with quantities
   - Calculate total value for each side using cached price data
   - Apply market volatility adjustments and confidence intervals
   - Generate fairness score with detailed breakdown

2. **Price Comparison Engine**
   - Leverage cached price data from task 004
   - Account for item condition, rolls, and modifiers
   - Apply market trend weighting for recent price movements
   - Include liquidity assessment for less common items

3. **Fairness Scoring Algorithm**
   - Base score derived from value differential
   - Adjustments for market volatility and item liquidity
   - Risk factors including item meta relevance
   - Confidence rating based on data quality and sample size

4. **Trade Insights Generation**
   - Identify significantly over/undervalued items
   - Market timing recommendations based on trends
   - Alternative trade suggestions for better value
   - Risk warnings for volatile or illiquid items

### Tool Schema

```typescript
interface EvaluateTradeParams {
  offered: TradeItem[];
  requested: TradeItem[];
  league?: string;
  includeAlternatives?: boolean;
  riskTolerance?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}

interface TradeItem {
  itemName: string;
  baseType?: string;
  quantity: number;
  modifiers?: string[];
  condition?: string;
}

interface TradeEvaluation {
  fairnessScore: number;
  offeredValue: ValueAnalysis;
  requestedValue: ValueAnalysis;
  recommendations: string[];
  risks: RiskFactor[];
  alternatives?: AlternativeTrade[];
}
```

### Key Algorithms
- Multi-item value aggregation with uncertainty propagation
- Market volatility weighting based on recent price history
- Liquidity scoring using trading volume and spread analysis
- Confidence interval calculation for value estimates
- Risk-adjusted fairness scoring with user preference integration

## Dependencies

**Depends on**:
- [004] - Basic Price Checking Tools: Requires price data and currency conversion
- [005] - Multi-tier Caching System: Requires cached market data for performance

**Sequential dependency**: Cannot start until both 004 and 005 are completed due to tight integration requirements.

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (12 hours)
- evaluate_trade tool core implementation: 4 hours
- Price comparison and fairness scoring algorithms: 4 hours
- Risk assessment and market trend integration: 2 hours
- Trade insights generation and reporting: 2 hours
