## Description

Implement a comprehensive testing suite for the POE2Scout MCP server, including unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and validation tools to ensure reliability, accuracy, and optimal performance of all trading tools.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for all MCP tools with 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for MCP protocol compliance and API interactions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for response times and throughput
- [ ] End-to-end testing scenarios for complete trading workflows
- [ ] Mock data and test fixtures for reproducible testing
- [ ] Automated test execution and CI/CD integration
- [ ] Load testing for high-frequency trading scenarios
- [ ] Error handling and edge case validation

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. **Unit Testing Framework**
   - Jest/Mocha test framework setup with TypeScript support
   - Individual tool function testing with mocked dependencies
   - Edge case and error condition validation
   - Code coverage reporting and threshold enforcement

2. **Integration Testing**
   - MCP protocol compliance testing
   - API endpoint integration validation
   - Cross-tool interaction testing
   - Authentication and authorization verification

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Response time benchmarking for all tools
   - Throughput testing under various load conditions
   - Memory usage and resource consumption monitoring
   - API rate limiting and throttling validation

4. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Complete trading workflow simulation
   - Real-world scenario testing with live data
   - Error recovery and fault tolerance validation
   - User experience and usability testing

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**
  - Tool function logic validation
  - Data parsing and transformation accuracy
  - Parameter validation and sanitization
  - Error handling and exception management

- **Integration Tests**
  - MCP server startup and shutdown procedures
  - Tool registration and discovery verification
  - API client connectivity and data retrieval
  - Database and cache integration testing

- **Performance Tests**
  - Tool execution speed benchmarks
  - Concurrent request handling capacity
  - Memory leak detection and prevention
  - Resource cleanup and garbage collection

- **End-to-End Tests**
  - Complete search and filter workflows
  - Price analysis and trend detection scenarios
  - Arbitrage detection and profit calculation flows
  - Multi-tool coordination and data consistency

### Test Data Management
```typescript
// Mock data generators for consistent testing
interface TestDataGenerator {
  generateItemListings(count: number): TradeListing[];
  generatePriceHistory(item: string, days: number): PricePoint[];
  generateMarketData(league: string): MarketSnapshot;
  generateArbitrageScenarios(): ArbitrageTestCase[];
}

// Test fixtures for reproducible scenarios
interface TestFixtures {
  sampleItems: ItemDatabase;
  priceHistories: Map<string, PricePoint[]>;
  marketConditions: MarketScenario[];
  errorConditions: ErrorTestCase[];
}
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Response Time Targets**
  - Simple searches: < 500ms
  - Complex filtering: < 1000ms
  - Price analysis: < 2000ms
  - Arbitrage detection: < 3000ms

- **Throughput Requirements**
  - 100+ concurrent tool executions
  - 1000+ API requests per minute
  - Real-time data processing capability
  - Sustainable performance under load

### Test Automation
- **Continuous Integration**
  - Automated test execution on code changes
  - Performance regression detection
  - Code coverage reporting and enforcement
  - Test result notifications and reporting

- **Test Scheduling**
  - Nightly performance benchmark runs
  - Weekly integration test full suite
  - Monthly end-to-end testing with live data
  - Quarterly load testing and capacity planning

### Quality Assurance Framework
```typescript
// Test validation framework
interface TestValidator {
  validateToolResponse(tool: string, params: any, response: any): ValidationResult;
  validatePerformance(tool: string, executionTime: number): PerformanceResult;
  validateDataAccuracy(expected: any, actual: any): AccuracyResult;
  validateErrorHandling(error: Error, expectedType: string): ErrorResult;
}

// Quality metrics and reporting
interface QualityMetrics {
  codeCoverage: number;
  testPassRate: number;
  performanceScore: number;
  reliabilityIndex: number;
  userSatisfactionScore: number;
}
```
