## Description

Implement an advanced arbitrage detection system for Path of Exile 2 trading that identifies pricing discrepancies across different sellers and calculates potential profit opportunities in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `find_arbitrage_opportunities` MCP tool for cross-seller price analysis
- [ ] `search_underpriced_items` tool for identifying below-market listings
- [ ] Profit margin calculations with transaction cost considerations
- [ ] Real-time opportunity scoring and ranking system
- [ ] Multi-league arbitrage detection capabilities
- [ ] Currency conversion and exchange rate integration
- [ ] Risk assessment for arbitrage opportunities
- [ ] Automated opportunity alerts and notifications

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. **Arbitrage Detection Engine**
   - Cross-reference prices across multiple sellers for identical items
   - Implement price comparison algorithms with quality adjustments
   - Real-time scanning of active trade listings
   - Currency arbitrage opportunities across different leagues

2. **Underpriced Item Detection**
   - Market price baselines using historical and current data
   - Statistical analysis to identify pricing anomalies
   - Machine learning models for fair value estimation
   - Seller reputation and listing age factors

3. **Profit Calculation System**
   - Transaction cost modeling (trade fees, travel time)
   - Risk-adjusted profit margins
   - Break-even analysis and minimum profit thresholds
   - ROI calculations for different investment levels

4. **Opportunity Ranking**
   - Scoring system based on profit potential, risk, and execution speed
   - Time-sensitive opportunity prioritization
   - Capital requirement analysis
   - Market liquidity considerations

### Key Features
- **find_arbitrage_opportunities(item_type?, min_profit?, max_risk?)**
  - Returns ranked list of arbitrage opportunities
  - Includes detailed profit analysis and execution steps
  - Provides risk assessment and confidence scores

- **search_underpriced_items(category?, league?, price_threshold?)**
  - Identifies items priced significantly below market value
  - Returns potential savings and fair value estimates
  - Includes seller credibility and listing freshness data

- **calculate_profit_margin(buy_price, sell_price, item_type)**
  - Computes net profit after all transaction costs
  - Includes opportunity cost and time value analysis
  - Provides break-even scenarios and risk metrics

### Data Models
```typescript
interface ArbitrageOpportunity {
  item: ItemDetails;
  buyListing: TradeListing;
  sellOpportunity: {
    estimatedPrice: number;
    confidence: number;
    timeToSell: number;
  };
  profit: {
    gross: number;
    net: number;
    margin: number;
    roi: number;
  };
  risk: {
    score: number;
    factors: string[];
    liquidityRisk: number;
  };
  execution: {
    steps: string[];
    timeRequired: number;
    capitalRequired: number;
  };
}

interface UnderPricedItem {
  listing: TradeListing;
  marketValue: {
    estimated: number;
    confidence: number;
    basis: string;
  };
  savings: {
    absolute: number;
    percentage: number;
  };
  qualityScore: number;
  urgency: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
}
```

### Risk Assessment Framework
- **Market Risk**: Price volatility and trend analysis
- **Liquidity Risk**: Time-to-sell estimates and market depth
- **Execution Risk**: Trade completion probability
- **Counter-party Risk**: Seller reputation and reliability

## Dependencies

**Depends on**: [004, 005]
- Task 004: Search and filtering tools for comprehensive item scanning
- Task 005: Trade listing tools for current market data access
- Requires real-time data feeds and market pricing information

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (14 hours)
- Arbitrage detection algorithms: 5 hours
- Profit calculation and risk assessment: 4 hours
- Underpriced item identification: 3 hours
- Integration, testing, and optimization: 2 hours
