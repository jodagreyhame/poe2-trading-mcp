## Description

Implement comprehensive market analysis tools for Path of Exile 2 trading, including price history analysis, market trend identification, and volatility calculations to provide traders with data-driven insights.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `analyze_price_history` MCP tool implemented with historical data processing
- [ ] `get_market_trends` tool for identifying trending items and price movements
- [ ] Price volatility analysis with statistical calculations
- [ ] Integration with existing trade data API endpoints
- [ ] Historical data caching and efficient retrieval
- [ ] Trend visualization data export capabilities
- [ ] Market sentiment analysis based on trading volumes
- [ ] Price prediction algorithms using historical patterns

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. **Price History Analysis**
   - Implement time-series data processing for item prices
   - Calculate moving averages, price ranges, and volatility metrics
   - Support multiple timeframes (1d, 7d, 30d, seasonal)
   - Historical data normalization and outlier detection

2. **Market Trend Detection**
   - Implement trend identification algorithms
   - Calculate price momentum and direction
   - Identify emerging market opportunities
   - Support for multiple item categories and leagues

3. **Volatility Analysis**
   - Statistical volatility calculations (standard deviation, coefficient of variation)
   - Risk assessment metrics for trading decisions
   - Market stability indicators
   - Price ceiling and floor detection

4. **Data Integration**
   - Leverage existing search and listing tools from tasks 004-005
   - Implement efficient data aggregation pipelines
   - Cache frequently accessed historical data
   - Support for real-time market updates

### Key Features
- **analyze_price_history(item_name, league, timeframe)**
  - Returns comprehensive price analysis with charts data
  - Includes volume analysis and trading frequency
  - Provides statistical summaries and key metrics

- **get_market_trends(category?, league?, limit?)**
  - Identifies trending items by price movement
  - Returns gainers, losers, and stable items
  - Includes market cap and trading volume data

- **calculate_volatility(item_name, league, period)**
  - Computes volatility metrics and risk indicators
  - Returns stability scores and confidence intervals
  - Provides trading recommendation flags

### Data Models
```typescript
interface PriceAnalysis {
  item: string;
  league: string;
  timeframe: string;
  priceHistory: PricePoint[];
  statistics: {
    average: number;
    median: number;
    volatility: number;
    trend: 'bullish' | 'bearish' | 'stable';
    confidence: number;
  };
  volume: VolumeData[];
}

interface MarketTrend {
  item: string;
  category: string;
  priceChange: {
    absolute: number;
    percentage: number;
  };
  volume: number;
  momentum: number;
  rank: number;
}
```

## Dependencies

**Depends on**: [004, 005]
- Task 004: Search and filtering tools for item data retrieval
